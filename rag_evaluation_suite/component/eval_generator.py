evals/eval_generator.py
=======================
Component-level evaluation of the GENERATOR, in isolation.

Faithfulness: of the claims in the generated answer, how many are supported
by the context it was given? (Did the generator make things up?)

ISOLATION: we feed the generator the GOLDEN context (the known-good chunks
from the faithfulness dataset), NOT the retriever's output. So a low score
is purely the generator's fault — the context was already correct.
